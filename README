Net::BGP::Router version 0.04
=============================

The Net-BGP-Router distribution includes a BGP router based on Net::BGP
which has support for multiple contexts and advanced policy routing
based on Net::ACL.

This module makes it posible to write a route-server with a policy
configured using a Cisco-style configurationfile in a few lines of code.
However, it still posible to make advanced dynamic policies that may
depend on e.g. round-trip times, packet losses or link load.

Any comments and feedback are more then welcome!
